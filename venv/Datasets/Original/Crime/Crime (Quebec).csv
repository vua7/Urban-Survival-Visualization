Footnotes:
1,"This product is based on data from the adult component of the Integrated Criminal Court Survey (ICCS). The ICCS is administered by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics (Statistics Canada) in collaboration with provincial and territorial government departments responsible for criminal courts in Canada. The survey collects statistical information on adult and youth court cases involving Criminal Code and other federal statute offences. Data contained in this table represent the adult criminal court portion of the survey, namely, individuals who were 18 years of age or older at the time of the offence. Data are based on a fiscal year (April 1 through March 31)."
2,"A case is one or more charges against an accused person or company, which were processed by the courts at the same time (date of offence, date of initiation, date of first appearance, or date of decision), and received a final decision. The definition attempts to reflect court processing. All data have been processed using this case definition. The case definition changed for the 2006/2007 release of data. The former definition (used in releases prior to October 2007) combined all charges against the same person disposed of in court on the same day into a case. Consequently, comparisons should not be made with data tables and reports released before that time."
3,"Cases are counted in the fiscal year in which they are completed. Every year, the Integrated Criminal Court Survey (ICCS) database is considered final at the end of March for the production of court statistics for the previous fiscal year. These counts do not include cases pending an outcome at the end of the reference period. If an outcome is reached in the next fiscal year, these cases are included in the completed case counts for that fiscal year. However, cases that are inactive for one year are deemed complete and the originally published counts for the previous fiscal year are updated and reported in the next fiscal year's data release. Prior to 2013/2014, this approach was difficult to apply in Quebec where information for the adult criminal courts from the Court of Quebec and the Superior Court was reported using the Adult Criminal Court Survey national data requirements (NDR) rather than the ICCS NDR. Inasmuch as possible, the data were converted to ICCS format during data processing. The methods that Quebec used to send data for the years prior to 2013/2014, in contrast with the other provinces, may have led to an overestimation of the median length of cases completed by Quebec courts during that time frame. As of the October 2019 release of the ICCS data, data for adult criminal courts in Quebec for the 2013/2014 reference period onward are reported using the ICCS NDR."
4,"Guilty findings include guilty of the charged offence, of an included offence, of an attempt of the charged offence, or of an attempt of an included offence. This category also includes guilty pleas, and cases where an absolute or conditional discharge has been imposed."
5,Table 35-10-0030 (formerly CANSIM table 252-0056) replaces table 252-0046 which has been archived.
6,"Prior to 2013/2014, the Quebec data were reported using a former version of the survey instrument, the Adult Criminal Court Survey (ACCS), rather than the Integrated Criminal Court Survey (ICCS), and were then converted to the ICCS national data requirements (NDR) during processing. As of the 2013/2014 reference period, data for the adult criminal courts in Quebec are reported using the ICCS NDR. Trend analysis of Quebec data should be done with caution and comparisons of Quebec data should not be made with data tables and reports released before October 2019."
7,"There are many factors that influence variations between jurisdictions. These may include Crown and police charging practices, offence distributions, and various forms of diversion programs. Therefore, comparisons between jurisdictions should be interpreted with caution."
8,"The Common Offence Classification (COC) is a standard grouping of offences (for example, major assault, impaired driving) involving 32 offence categories. This offence framework permits users to compare analytical results across the different databases, and to examine data from different sectors of the justice system using a single set of offence categories. Each common offence category is constructed by aggregating individual Uniform Crime Reporting offence categories into the larger common categories."
9,"A case that has more than one charge is represented by the charge with the ""most serious offence"" (MSO). The most serious offence is selected using the following rules. First, court decisions are considered and the charge with the ""most serious decision"" (MSD) is selected. Court decisions for each charge in a case are ranked from most to least serious as follows: (1) guilty, (2) guilty of a lesser offence, (3) acquitted, (4) stay of proceeding, (5) withdrawn, dismissed or discharged, (6) not criminally responsible, (7) other, and (8) transfer of court jurisdiction. Second, in cases where two or more charges result in the same MSD (for example, guilty), Criminal Code sanctions are considered. The charge with the most serious offence type is selected according to an offence seriousness scale, based on actual sentences handed down by courts in Canada (The offence seriousness scale is calculated using data from both the adult and youth components of the Integrated Criminal Court Survey). Each offence type is ranked by looking at (1) the proportion of guilty charges where custody was imposed and (2) the average (mean) length of custody for the specific type of offence. These values are multiplied together to arrive at the final seriousness ranking for each type of offence. If, after looking at the offence seriousness scale, two or more charges remain tied then information about the sentence type and duration of the sentence are considered (for example, custody and length of custody, then probation and length of probation, etcetera)."
10,Age is the age of the accused at the time of the offence.
11,"Sex is determined on the basis of the accused's name in Quebec, producing a relatively higher rate of sex unknown."
12,Information on the sex of the accused is not available from Manitoba.
13,"In Quebec, provincial court data are available beginning in 1994/1995. Information from municipal courts is not available. In Quebec, some municipal courts hear cases under Part XXVII of the Criminal Code, that is, summary convictions. For example, among all municipal courts that hear cases under Part XXVII of the Criminal Code, 19,491 cases were opened in 2016 and 19,129 in 2017. Cases heard by municipal courts account for approximately 14% of all criminal cases opened in Quebec. Such cases are excluded from the information that Quebec transmits to Statistics Canada."
14,Quebec did not provide data on restitution for fiscal year 2000/2001.
15,Quebec did not report conditional sentencing data for reference periods prior to 2013/2014.
16,Information on offences against the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) is not available from Quebec.
17,"Pre-charge screening refers to a formal process whereby a Crown prosecutor (as opposed to police) determines whether a charge is officially laid and proceeds to court. Pre-charge screening is meant to keep less serious cases out of the court system and reduce court workload. The use of pre-charge screening by the Crown may also affect the number and percentage of cases resulting in a guilty finding through increased vetting of charges. Currently in Canada, pre-charge screening systems are in place in New Brunswick, Quebec and British Columbia."
18,"In Ontario, sentencing detail was not available for 17% of guilty decisions in the fourth quarter of 2001/2002. This data-reporting limitation affects 4% of all guilty decisions for this reference period."
19,"Cases can have more than one sentence. Therefore, sanctions are not mutually exclusive and will not add to 100%. Sentencing information is not available for a small proportion of guilty cases (i.e., approximately 3%, overall).  For all sentencing tables, data are for cases with a guilty finding only and for which sentencing information is reported."
20,"Since 2004/2005 for the Northwest Territories, the number of custody orders have been under-reported and the number of probation orders have been over-reported by unknown amounts due to clerical procedures. The majority of custody orders were captured as probation."
21,"In Newfoundland and Labrador, data on conditional sentencing and probation conditions were not available for 20% of adult criminal court locations for 1998/1999."
22,The Northwest Territories does not report conditional sentencing data at this time.
23,"The conditional sentence of imprisonment option came into effect under Bill C-41 in September 1996. When a conditional sentence is imposed, the offender serves their sentence in the community under supervision. The prerequisites for imposing a conditional sentence include: the offence must not have a prescribed minimum sentence; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for the offence must be less than 2 years; and the court must be satisfied that the offender would not endanger the safety of the community. The offender who receives such a conditional sentence of imprisonment must abide by certain conditions, such as ""house arrest"", curfew, alcohol or driving prohibition, treatment programs or a community service order, and may be sent to prison if he or she violates those conditions. The collection of data on conditional sentences across jurisdictions is not consistent over time. Yukon began reporting conditional sentencing data in 1996/1997; Saskatchewan began in 1997/1998; Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario and Alberta began in 1998/1999; Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia began in 1999/2000; New Brunswick and British Columbia began in 2000/2001; Nunavut began in 2002/2003, Manitoba in 2005/2006 and Quebec in 2013/2014. The Northwest Territories does not report conditional sentencing data at this time."
24,Probation is mandatory in cases where the accused is given a conditional discharge or a suspended sentence.
25,"""Other"" sentences include absolute and conditional discharge, suspended sentence, community service order and prohibition order among others."
