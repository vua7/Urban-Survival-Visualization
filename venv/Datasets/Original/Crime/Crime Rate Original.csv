2016-03-31T04:00:00Z,"On March 31, 2016, the provincial and territorial total for total custodial admissions, total sentenced admissions and total remand admissions for 2014-2015 were corrected."

Footnotes:
1,"This product is based on data from the Adult Correctional Services Survey (ACS), the Integrated Correctional Services Survey (ICSS) and the Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS). The ACS, the ICSS and CCSS are administered by the Canadian Centre for Justice and Community Safety Statistics (Statistics Canada) in collaboration with adult provincial/territorial and federal correctional systems responsible for correctional services in Canada. These surveys collect statistical information on the delivery of adult correctional services and provide important indicators as to the nature and characteristics of correctional case-flow."
2,"The Adult Correctional Services Survey (ACS) is an aggregate survey whose reporting jurisdictions currently include: Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Manitoba, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. The Integrated Correctional Services Survey (ICSS) is a microdata survey which supplies data to the ACS. Reporting jurisdictions currently include: Newfoundland and Labrador (Adult), New Brunswick, Ontario, and Correctional Service Canada. The Canadian Correctional Services Survey (CCSS) is a new microdata survey being implemented to replace the ICSS. Reporting jurisdictions currently include: Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta (adult) and British Columbia. Data for Alberta are not available from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016. For all Canadian Correctional Services Survey and Integrated Correctional Services Survey data respondents, comparisons to data prior to their implementation to the microdata survey should be made with caution. Data are based on a fiscal year (April 1 through March 31). Due to rounding, figures may not add to totals. These data are administrative data. Although the surveys attempt to standardize the way in which data are reported, limitations due to differences among jurisdictional operations may restrict uniform application of the definitions in some situations. For this reason, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of the data should be made with caution."
3,"On March 31, 2016, the provincial and territorial total for total custodial admissions, total sentenced admissions and total remand admissions for 2014-2015 were corrected."
4,Provincial and territorial sentenced admissions include provincial and territorial inmate admissions as well as federal inmates admitted to the provincial and territorial system prior to being transferred to a federal penitentiary.
5,The total does not necessarily represent all provinces and territories as there are variations in the availability of data for certain jurisdictions and years. Comparison among years at the national level should be made with caution. Detailed data availability information can be found in the notes associated to the provinces or territories.
6,"Admissions are counted each time a person begins any period of supervision in a correctional institution or in the community. These data describe and measure the flow of persons through correctional services over time. The same person may be included several times in the admission counts where he/she moves from one correctional program to another (e.g., from remand to sentenced custody) or re-enters the system later in the same year. Admissions therefore represent the number of entries of persons, during a fiscal year, to remand, sentenced custody or a community supervision program, regardless of the previous legal status."
7,"Total custodial admissions are totals of sentenced (including intermittent sentences), remand and other custodial status admissions."
8,"Sentenced custody is the detention of offenders convicted of a crime, either in a federal (two years or more), or a provincial/territorial (less than two years) facility. Sentenced custody admissions include admissions to intermittent sentences."
9,"Remand is the detention of a person in custody while awaiting a further court appearance. These persons have not been sentenced and can be held for a number of reasons (e.g., risk that they won't appear for their court date, danger to themselves and/or others, risk to re-offend). Remand is the responsibility of provincial/territorial correctional services."
10,"Other custodial statuses include persons who are being held in provincial/territorial correctional institutions for lock-ups, parole violations or suspensions, immigration holds, and those who are temporarily detained without warrants of any type."
11,"Total community admissions are the sum of probation, conditional sentence, and other community programs. The conditional sentencing option came into effect in 1996/1997."
12,"Probation orders are dispositions imposed by the Court that are a non-custodial sentence. The offender is released into the community under the supervision of a probation officer. The release is conditional on the offender acting in a manner stipulated by the Court. Probation is mandatory when the accused is given a suspended sentence or a conditional discharge. For those jurisdictions that do not operate a provincial or territorial parole board (i.e. all but Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia (until March 31, 2007)), the probation caseload may also include a small number of provincial or territorial parolees. Probation is supervised by provincial/territorial correctional services."
13,"Conditional sentence of imprisonment option came into effect in September 1996. When a conditional sentence is imposed, the offender serves their sentence in the community under supervision. The prerequisites for imposing a conditional sentence include: the offence must not have a prescribed minimum sentence; the maximum sentence of imprisonment for the offence must be less than two years; and the court must be satisfied that the offender would not endanger the safety of the community. The offender who receives such a conditional sentence of imprisonment must abide by certain conditions, such as ""house arrest"", curfew, alcohol or driving prohibition, treatment programs or a community service order, and may be sent to prison if he or she violates those conditions. Conditional sentences are supervised by provincial/territorial correctional services."
14,"Other community programs includes for example, community service orders, provincial paroles, fine option programs, bail supervision and restitution orders. Due to limitations and differences among jurisdictional programs, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of the data should be made with caution."
15,"As of 2011/2012, data on the fine option program is not available for Manitoba."
